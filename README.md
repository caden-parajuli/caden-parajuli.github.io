## About me

- I'm a student at Boston College majoring in mathematics and computer science.
- My interests include compilers, type theory, algebraic topology, and embedded systems.
- My main languages of choice are Rust, Go, and OCaml, although I am a bit of a PL nerd and have experience with many other languages.
